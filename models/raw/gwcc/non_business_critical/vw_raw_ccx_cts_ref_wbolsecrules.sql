Date            Version         Author          Description of Change           
2026-01-01      0.0                             This Converts Parquet or AVRO Data Loaded in the Variant Column in the RAW DB into Flattend Views
                                                This also creates a HASH_KEY for Incremental Tables for the Curated Layer 
                                                Additional CDA Files are Null in the AVRO but not in CDA .
                                                UNION ALL for BackFill of Data i.e. Incase of Rebuild of Upstream Model
